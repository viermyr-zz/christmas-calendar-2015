This document explains the idea behind the christmas calendar for Sarita - 2015:

1) Buy 24 small christmas calendar presents
2) Mark all of them with different signs (e.g. X, 121 etc)
3) Create a webbased application with 24 hatches with associated numers
4) Make each of them accessible (can be clicked) at 00:00 (UTC+2) on the day they can be opened
5) When they are opened: Present a quiz of some sort (e.g. 2+5/2 = ?). When the task is solved, present the soltuion/ sign
6) The sign explains which present can be opened
